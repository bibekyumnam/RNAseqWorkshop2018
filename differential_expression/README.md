 - [Differential expression slides (includes extra slides)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregomics/RNAseqWorkshop2018/master/differential_expression/ga_rnaseq_workshop_mik_slides-20181204.pdf)
 - [R code used for differential expression analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregomics/RNAseqWorkshop2018/master/differential_expression/ga_rnaseq_workshop_mik_rcode-20181129.R)
 - [Count data for differential expression analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregomics/RNAseqWorkshop2018/master/differential_expression/CountMat_NCBIM37.67.dat)

For getting the count data into our R project, we'll use the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregomics/RNAseqWorkshop2018/master/differential_expression/CountMat_NCBIM37.67.dat
```
